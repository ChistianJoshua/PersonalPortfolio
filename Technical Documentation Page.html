        <p>Welcome to <span style="font-weight: bolder;">Section 1</span> of the HTML Documentation! In this section, we'll provide you with a comprehensive introduction to HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), the fundamental building block of the World Wide Web.</p>
    
        <h2>What is HTML?</h2>
        <p>HTML, which stands for Hypertext Markup Language, is the standard markup language for creating web pages. It provides the structure and layout of a web document by using a variety of tags and attributes to describe the content.</p>
    
        <h2>Why Learn HTML?</h2>
        <p>Learning HTML is essential for anyone interested in web development. HTML serves as the foundation for building websites and web applications. Understanding HTML allows you to create well-structured and semantically meaningful web pages that are accessible to all users.</p>
    
        <h2>What Will You Learn in Section 1?</h2>
        <p>In this section, you'll learn the following key concepts:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The basics of HTML syntax, including elements, tags, and attributes.</li>

    <section id="section_2" class="main-section">
        <header><div class="bordered">Section 2: HTML Elements and Syntax</div></header>
        <p>Welcome to <span style="font-weight: bolder;">Section 2</span> of the HTML Documentation! In this section, we'll explore HTML elements and syntax in more detail.</p>
    
        <h2>HTML Elements</h2>
        <p>HTML elements are the building blocks of web pages. Each element represents a specific type of content and has its own purpose and behavior. Some common HTML elements include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> - Heading</li>
            <li><code>&lt;p&gt;</code> - Paragraph</li>
            <li><code>&lt;a&gt;</code> - Anchor (Link)</li>
            <li><code>&lt;img&gt;</code> - Image</li>
            <li><code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> - Unordered List</li>
            <li><code>&lt;li&gt;</code> - List Item</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h2>HTML Syntax</h2>
        <p>HTML syntax consists of a set of rules for writing HTML code. Key components of HTML syntax include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Opening and closing tags: HTML elements are enclosed within opening and closing tags, which define the beginning and end of the element.</li>
            <li>Attributes: HTML elements can have attributes that provide additional information about the element, such as its appearance or behavior.</li>
            <li>Nesting: HTML elements can be nested inside other elements to create hierarchical structures.</li>
            <li>Self-closing tags: Some HTML elements are self-closing, meaning they don't require a separate closing tag.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h2>HTML Document Structure</h2>
        <p>Every HTML document follows a specific structure, known as the HTML document structure. It consists of several key components:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code> declaration</li>
            <li><code>&lt;html&gt;</code> element</li>
            <li><code>&lt;head&gt;</code> element</li>
            <li><code>&lt;title&gt;</code> element</li>
            <li><code>&lt;body&gt;</code> element</li>
        </ol>
    
        <p>In the next sections, we'll delve deeper into each of these topics and explore advanced HTML concepts.</p>

    <section id="section_3" class="main-section">
        <header><div class="bordered">Section 3: HTML Document Structure</div></header>
        <p>Welcome to <span style="font-weight: bolder;">Section 3</span> of the HTML Documentation! In this section, we'll explore the structure of an HTML document in detail.</p>
    
        <h2>HTML Document Structure</h2>
        <p>Every HTML document follows a specific structure, known as the HTML document structure. Understanding this structure is crucial for creating well-formed and valid HTML documents. The basic structure of an HTML document includes the following components:</p>
    
        <ol>
            <li><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code> declaration: This declaration defines the document type and version of HTML being used.</li>
            <li><code>&lt;html&gt;</code> element: The root element of an HTML document, encapsulating all other elements.</li>
            <li><code>&lt;head&gt;</code> element: Contains meta-information about the document, such as the document title, character set, and external resources like stylesheets and scripts.</li>
            <li><code>&lt;title&gt;</code> element: Defines the title of the document, which appears in the browser's title bar or tab.</li>
            <li><code>&lt;body&gt;</code> element: Contains the main content of the document, including text, images, links, and other elements visible to the user.</li>
        </ol>
    
        <h2>Example HTML Document</h2>
        <p>Here's an example of a simple HTML document structure:</p>
    
        <pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
    &lt;html&gt;
      &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;My First HTML Document&lt;/title&gt;
      &lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;h1&gt;Hello, World!&lt;/h1&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph of text.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/body&gt;
    &lt;/html&gt;
        </code></pre>
    
        <p>This basic structure forms the foundation of all HTML documents and provides a framework for organizing and presenting content on the web.</p>
    
        <h2>Next Steps</h2>
        <p>Now that you understand the structure of an HTML document, you're ready to start creating your own web pages! In the next section, we'll dive deeper into HTML elements and learn how to use them to create rich and interactive web content.</p>
